## Introduction
Welcome to the 'Hang Man' game! This project was developed for a school assignment in which we were focussing on building a simple UI for a game.

## How to play
- At the start of the game, you will be presented with lines that represent the letters left to guess:

- Type a letter in the box and submit it to see whether it is a correct guess or not.
- The letters that have already been guessed will appear in the *'Guessed letters'* box at the bottom. You will be notified if you have submitted a letter which has already been guessed:

- A correct guess will result in that letter being filled in on the lines above.
- An incorrect guess will result in a body part being added to the *'Hang man'* image.
- The game ends when either you have either filled in all the letters of the word, or you have run out of guessed by completing the *'Hang man'* image:
